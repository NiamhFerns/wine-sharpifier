# wine-sharpifier
This is a C# rewrite of my Rust wine-classifier assignment that I did for COMP 307.

## Usage
Built with C#10. 

Simply clone this repo and run with `dotnet run --project wine-sharpifier.csproj`.

By default runs with K = 3. You can set this to some other value of K if you'd like.
